Age is just a data type. The code journey of a 59-year-old forklift driver learning Dart and Flutter from scratch. From manual to digital. 

I have many ideas for projects as I learn to code:
  * Box Calculator (Dart)
  * Box Calculator (Flutter)
  * Pallet Estimator
  * Reality TV Fantasy Game
  * FlexWord School
  * FlexWord
  * Freezer Inventory
  * Fruit Roundup
  * Firework Demo
  * and finally, My Dream Idea.


These may mean nothing to you (and maybe me, too), but follow along and give me advise. I'll need it. Thanks.
